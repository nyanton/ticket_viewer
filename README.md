# Ticket Viewer
This project is being completed for a code challenge posed by Zendesk, as part of the Software Engineering Internship interview process.

This program makes use of the zendesk_api gem. The zendesk_api is used to access the endpoints.

# Using the Ticket Viewer
Simply clone the repository, and then use `ruby ticket_viewer.rb`.  

# Assumptions
This program assumes that no new tickets will be added into the account while the program is in use.  Though it will be able to handle if tickets are added from a third party, it will not be able to create or delete tickets.

###TO DO
* Tests
* Move menu and ticket_handler items around
* README needs to have usage instructions as well as installation instructions
* Error Handling, especially look into
